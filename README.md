# Bulls

### What this is
When I first started coding, I followed a tutorial where I wrote a program that would display the 1998 Chicago Bulls starting lineup. That was in Python initially (that program is in the `python` folder as `bulls.py`. It's essentially the same as the one in the tutorial I followed). Since then, I've been using that program to help me learn new languages.

So far, I have Python, Rust, and C++. I'm currently working on a Solidity version and will be adding more languages in the future.

As an aside, if you'd like to check out the same tutorial, visit [likeiamfive.com](https://likeiamfive.com/). The instructor, Matt Blank, is a great guy and he's the main reason I'm a programmer now.
